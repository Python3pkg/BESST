	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of short reads from High Throughput Sequencing
(HTS) techniques is now commonplace in de novo assembly. Yet,
obtaining contiguous assemblies from short reads is challenging,
thus making scaffolding an important  step in the assembly pipeline.
Different algorithms have been proposed but many of them use the
number of read pairs supporting a linking of two contigs as an
indicator of reliability. This reasoning is intuitive, but fails
to account for variation in link count due to contig features.We
have also noted that published  scaffolders are only evaluated
on small datasets using output from only one assembler. Two issues
arise from this. Firstly, some of the available tools are not
well suited for complex genomes. Secondly, these evaluations provide
little support for inferring a software's general performance.
RESULTS: We propose a new algorithm, implemented in a tool called
BESST, which can scaffold genomes of all  sizes and complexities
and was used to scaffold the genome of P. abies (20 Gbp).  We
performed a comprehensive comparison of BESST against the most
popular stand-alone scaffolders on a large variety of datasets.
Our results confirm that  some of the popular scaffolders are
not practical to run on complex datasets. Furthermore, no single
stand-alone scaffolder outperforms the others on all datasets.
However, BESST fares favorably to the other tested scaffolders
on GAGE  datasets and, moreover, outperforms the other methods
when library insert size distribution is wide. CONCLUSION: We
conclude from our results that information sources other than
the quantity of links, as is commonly used, can provide useful
information about genome structure when scaffolding.}

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: One of the important steps of genome assembly is scaffolding,
in which contigs are linked using information from read-pairs.
Scaffolding provides  estimates about the order, relative orientation
and distance between contigs. We  have found that contig distance
estimates are generally strongly biased and based on false assumptions.
Since erroneous distance estimates can mislead in subsequent analysis,
it is important to provide unbiased estimation of contig distance.
RESULTS: In this article, we show that state-of-the-art programs
for scaffolding are using an incorrect model of gap size estimation.
We discuss why current maximum likelihood estimators are biased
and describe what different cases of bias we are facing. Furthermore,
we provide a model for the distribution of reads that span a gap
and derive the maximum likelihood equation for the gap length.
We motivate why this estimate is sound and show empirically that
it outperforms gap estimators in popular scaffolding programs.
Our results have consequences both for scaffolding software, structural
variation detection and for library insert-size estimation as
is commonly performed by read aligners. AVAILABILITY: A reference
