INSTALLATION:
--------------

Using one of the the package installers pip or easy_install for python, type (in terminal):

sudo pip install BESST

or 

sudo easy_install BESST

If you do not have pip or easy install for python, you can get e.g. pip as follows:

curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py

With proper installation of BESST, you should be able to run:

runBESST -h

to view user instructions.

(This installation will install the two nonstandard python module dependencies: pysam 0.6, networkx-1.6 automatically for you.)
